\section{Multi-task Multiple-kernel Learning}

take datasets show multi task is better than single task
multi task is better than single kernel
gives advantage in terms of test accuracy.

point out that mtmkl for cancers in context of Cscape.



\subsection{Widmer ratsch original paper}

minimise

\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{R}(w) + C \mathcal{L}(w),
\end{equation}

where \(\mathcal{L}(w)\) is loss-term measuring training error and
\(\mathcal{R}(w)\) is regulariser penalising the complexity of the model, \(w\).

When considering multi task. there are several models \(w_1,...,w_T\), where \(T\) is the number of tasks.

normally make a joint regularisation term to penalise discrepancy between individual models

\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{R}(w_1,...,w_T) + C \mathcal{L}(w_1,...,w_T),
\end{equation}

Often formulate task similarity matrix for regulariser.
