abstract = {Control can enable high-bandwidth nanopositioning needed to increase the operating speed of scanning probe microscopes (SPMs). High-speed SPMs can substantially impact the throughput of a wide range of emerging nanosciences and nanotechnologies. In particular, inversion-based control can find the feedforward input needed to account for the positioning dynamics and, thus, achieve the required precision and bandwidth. This article reviews inversion-based feedforward approaches used for high-speed SPMs such as optimal inversion that accounts for model uncertainty and inversion-based iterative control for repetitive applications. The article establishes connections to other existing methods such as zero-phase-error-tracking feedforward and robust feedforward. Additionally, the article reviews the use of feedforward in emerging applications such as SPM-based nanoscale combinatorial-science studies, image-based control for subnanometer-scale studies, and imaging of large soft biosamples with SPMs.},

@article{Liu2013,
abstract = {A physics-based fractional-order Maxwell resistive capacitor (FOMRC) model is proposed to characterize nonlinear hysteresis and creep behaviors of a piezoelectric actuator (PEA). The Maxwell resistive capacitor (MRC) model is interpreted physically in the electric domain for PEAs. Based on this interpretation, the MRC model is modified to directly describe the relationship between the input voltage and the output displacement of a PEA. Then a procedure is developed to identify the parameters of the MRC model. This procedure is capable of being carried out using the measured input and output of a PEA only. A fractional-order dynamics is integrated into the MRC model to describe the effect of creep, as well as the detachment of hysteresis loops caused by creep. Moreover, the inverse FOMRC model is constructed to compensate for hysteresis and creep in an open-loop positioning application of PEAs. Simulation and experiments are carried out to validate the proposed model. The PEA compensated by the inverse FOMRC model shows an excellent linear behavior.
